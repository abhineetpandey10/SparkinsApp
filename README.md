# SparkinsApp

## The Problem

Parkinson's disease is a nervous system disorder that leads to lack of control , shakiness, stiffness and declining health in the patient's body. It is the second most common nervous disorder. 

## Our Solution

We have created a revolutionary app which aims at making the life of Parkinson's patients a bit easier and help them track their fitness and health, Sparkins.

Sparkins uses Machine learning model to analyze handwriting of patients and in turn determine the condition of their hand tremors, which is an important indicator of the condition and progression of their disease. The app also has a chatbot with which the patients can chat, if they ever feel lonely, depressed or overly anxious. We have used the Google DialogFlow Framework for making the chatbot. Medical discipline is very necessary for parkinson's patients. They must adhere strictly to their medicine schedule to improve their conditions, and keep the disease from becoming worse. Keeping this in mind, we have included a medicine reminder for the Parkinson's patients. Exercising helps the Parkinson's patients to keep their body healthy and reduces the risk of muscle stiffening, freezing of gait and slowness of movement (bradykinesia). Sparkins boasts of a feature that assists Parkinson's patients while exercising by telling them whether they are doing it correctly or not. It uses a Pose Detection Machine Learning model for this purpose.

Overall Sparkins provides all the necessary features an app needs to have to keep the people suffering from parkinson's disease physically and mentally fit.
